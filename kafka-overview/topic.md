# Topic

#### Create Topic

```text
./bin/kafka-topics --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 3 --partitions 20 --topic myTopic
```

#### Topic List

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```java
./bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
```

#### Describe a Topic

```text
./bin/kafka-topics --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic myTopic
```

#### Get Topic Offset

```text
./bin/kafka-run-class kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell --broker-list localhost:9092 --time -1 --topic myTopic
```

### TODO

Change the number of partitions and replication factor of a Topic

### Partitions

Topics contain logically related messages which are divided into a number of partitions. Partitions serve as our unit or ordering, replication, and parallelism

### Replication Factor

Topics are configured with a replication-factor, which determines the number of copies of each partition we have. All replicas of a partition exist on separate brokers \(the nodes of the Kafka cluster\). This means that we cannot have more replicas of a partition than we have nodes in the cluster.

### In-Sync Replicas

A replica is either the leader of its partition, or a follower of the leader. A follower can either be in-sync with the leader \(contains all the partition-leaderâ€™s messages, except for messages within a small buffer window\), or out-of-sync. The set of all in-sync replicas \(including the partition-leader\) is referred to as the ISR.

#### Minimum In-Sync Replica

The minimum number of in-sync replicas specify how many replicas that are needed to be available for the producer to successfully send records to a partition.

OR

min.insync.replicas is a config on the broker that denotes the minimum number of in-sync replicas required to exist for a broker to allow acks=all requests.
